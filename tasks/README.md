# Task list

- [x] Communicate with hovercraft using Python interface
- [ ] Wrap Python code to Matlab (optional)
- [ ] Write simulator of surface ship model in Matlab using some parameters (m, I)
- [ ] Write offline parameter identification (using fmincon) in Matlab and validate with simulation data
- [ ] If identification validated go to camera room to test on real system

## Week 3
- [ ] Use Euler method and check if discretisation is good enough (K)
- [ ] Parameter ID local frame with velocity (M)
- [ ] Derive the RK4 by hand (Both)
- [ ] Look at parameter ID with Gaussian Process paper (directly working with ODE)
- [ ] Look at parameter ID with Extended KF paper

## Week 4
